        <h2><strong>Why we made Xpenses</strong></h2>
        <p>Xpenses was born from a personal need: we wanted a truly secure and private way to manage our family's expenses. For years, we tried using spreadsheets, but they were always clunky and hard to use on our phones. We found ourselves frustrated, making mistakes, and spending more time inputting data than actually understanding our finances. It also meant we had to spend a lot of time organizing our finances across multiple sheets and making connections between them.</p>

        <p>We looked at the apps available on the market, but most were either too expensive, too complicated, or asked for access to things we felt should remain private (like our bank accounts and personal data). We didn't want to trade our privacy for convenience, and we didn't want to pay monthly fees for features we didn't need. We wanted something that stayed in our phones, or if it had to leave, that it wasn't in the hands of third parties who could sell it or suffer security breaches.</p>

        <p>That's why we decided to build Xpenses. We wanted an app that put privacy first, let us share expenses with family members easily, and could be customized to fit the way we live. Every family is different, and the things that matter to one person might not matter to another. Xpenses is designed to be flexible, so you can track what matters most to you, without being forced into someone else's idea of how budgeting should work.</p>

        <p>We also wanted to keep things honest and upfront. In-app purchases are there to help us cover the costs of development and maintenance. We initially made this app for ourselves, and we decided to share it because we believe it can help other families or individuals, too.</p>

        <p>In the end, Xpenses is more than just an app, it's a reflection of our values. We hope it brings a little more clarity, control, and peace of mind to you, just as it has to us.</p>
