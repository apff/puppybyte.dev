      <h2>End User License Agreement</h2>
      <p>This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you and PuppyByte for the Xpenses mobile application ("App") available through Apple's App Store.</p>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Data and Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App prioritizes your privacy with flexible storage options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage (Default):</strong> Data stored only on your device</li>
        <li><strong>iCloud Sync (Premium):</strong> End-to-end encrypted storage in your personal iCloud account</li>
        <li><strong>CSV Export/Import (Premium):</strong> Manual backup capabilities</li>
        <li><strong>Family Sharing (Premium):</strong> Optional sharing with invited iCloud users</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Privacy Protection:</strong> We do not collect, access, or store your financial data. All data remains under your control on your devices or in your iCloud account.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> End-to-end encryption means data may be permanently lost if you lose iCloud Keychain access without proper recovery options. Maintain device backups and Apple ID recovery methods.</p>
