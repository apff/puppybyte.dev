        <p>Welcome to Xpenses! You're about to discover how refreshingly simple it is to track your finances while keeping complete control over your data. In just a few minutes, you'll be ready to build healthy money habits that actually stick.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Magic of Manual Tracking</h2>

      <p>Instead of peeking into your bank accounts, Xpenses puts you in control. Every transaction you enter builds awareness, turning unconscious spending into conscious choices. That impulse buy? Now it's a decision, not just a mystery charge.</p>

      <h2>Your First Transaction (30 seconds)</h2>
      
      <div class="article-image-side">
        <div class="content">
          <p>Ready to start? Open Xpenses and follow these simple steps:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Tap the + icon</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Add a title</strong> - "Coffee Corner" or "Grocery Store" works perfectly</li>
            <li><strong>Enter the amount</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Pick a category</strong> - just tap the one that fits best</li>
            <li><strong>Tap Done</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <p>That's it! Your first transaction is logged. Do this a few times throughout your day: while waiting for your coffee, after grocery shopping, or during a quick break.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="article-highlight">
        <p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> The best time to add transactions? Right when they happen. Waiting in line, getting your receipt, or sitting in your car before driving. It becomes second nature in just a few days!</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Understanding Your Three Views</h2>

      <p>Xpenses organizes your financial life into three simple views:</p>

      <div class="feature-callout">
        <h4><i class="bi bi-calendar-month"></i> Current Month Expenses</h4>
        <p>Your home base. See exactly where your money goes with a clear pie chart breakdown.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-callout">
        <h4><i class="bi bi-cash-stack"></i> Current Month Income</h4>
        <p>Swipe left to track money coming in. Perfect for freelancers or anyone with multiple income sources.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="feature-callout">
        <h4><i class="bi bi-bar-chart"></i> Year Overview</h4>
        <p>Swipe left again for the big picture. Watch your financial patterns emerge over time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="article-image">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/year_overview.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Year overview showing financial patterns and trends">
        <p class="image-caption">The year overview gives you powerful insights into your spending patterns and trends over time.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Smart Features That Save Time</h2>

      <h3>Recurring Transactions</h3>
      <p>Got a monthly subscription or weekly coffee habit? Set up recurring transactions once, and Xpenses handles the rest automatically. Just tap the recurrence option when adding any transaction.</p>

      <h3>Quick Search</h3>
      <p>Need to find that restaurant bill from last week? Tap the magnifying glass and search by name, amount, or category. It's like having a personal finance detective.</p>

      <h3>Smart Categories</h3>
      <p>Start with our thoughtful defaults, then customize to match your lifestyle. With Premium, create categories that completely mirror your spending habits.</p>

      <h2>Your First Week Success Plan</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Day 1-3:</strong> Focus on just tracking expenses. Don't worry about being perfect. Build the habit first.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 4-5:</strong> Add income tracking. See the complete picture of money in and out.</li>
        <li><strong>Day 6-7:</strong> Explore your data. Tap on pie chart sections, check the year view, get curious about your patterns.</li>
      </ul>
