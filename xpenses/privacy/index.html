    <h1>Privacy Policy for Xpenses</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: {{ page.last_updated }}</p>
    
    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Xpenses is a privacy-focused expense tracking application designed to keep your financial data completely private and under your control.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>All your expense data is stored exclusively in your personal iCloud database. This means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your data is stored in your private iCloud account</li>
        <li>We do not have access to your financial information</li>
        <li>We do not store any of your data on our servers</li>
        <li>Your data is protected by Apple's iCloud security and encryption</li>
        <li>Xpenses utilizes Apple's CloudKit encryption support for end-to-end encryption of your data</li>
        <li>Your financial information is encrypted in such a way that not even Apple can access it</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> Because we use end-to-end encryption, if you lose access to your iCloud Keychain and don't have recovery options set up, your encrypted data may be permanently lost if you don't have a device where the app has synced all data locally. We strongly recommend maintaining proper iCloud Keychain backup and recovery mechanisms.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>Xpenses offers the ability to share expense information with family members or others. Here's how data sharing works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sharing is completely optional and under your control</li>
        <li>You explicitly choose with whom to share your data</li>
        <li>Sharing works through iCloud's shared database functionality</li>
        <li>Only specifically invited iCloud users can access your shared data</li>
        <li>You can revoke access at any time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We never share your data with third parties, advertisers, or data brokers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Analytics and Crash Reporting</h2>
      <!-- <p>To improve the app, we may collect anonymous usage statistics and crash reports. This data never includes your financial information or personal details. You can opt out of this collection in the app settings.</p> -->
       <p>We currently do not collect any user analytics or user crash report data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>
      <p>You maintain complete control of your data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delete any or all of your data from the app at any time</li>
        <li>Export your data in standard formats</li>
        <li>Control sharing permissions with other users</li>
        <!-- <li>Opt out of anonymous usage statistics</li> -->
