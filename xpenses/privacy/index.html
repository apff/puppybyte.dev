    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>PuppyByte ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with the Xpenses mobile application ("App") available on Apple's App Store. Xpenses is a privacy-focused expense tracking application designed to keep your financial data completely private and under your control.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Privacy Principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Privacy by Design:</strong> Your financial data remains on your devices and in your personal iCloud account only</li>
        <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We do not collect, store, or process your financial data on our servers</li>
        <li><strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> When using iCloud sync, your data is protected with end-to-end encryption</li>
        <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You decide what data to store, where to store it, and whom to share it with</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      
      <h3>Personal Information</h3>
      <p><strong>We do not collect personal information.</strong> The App operates without requiring account creation, email addresses, or any personal identifiers.</p>
      
      <h3>Financial Data</h3>
      <p><strong>We do not collect or access your financial data.</strong> All expense tracking information, categories, budgets, and related financial data you enter into the App remains exclusively under your control and is stored as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> By default, stored only on your iOS device using SwiftData</li>
        <li><strong>iCloud Storage (Optional):</strong> If you enable iCloud sync, stored in your personal iCloud account using CloudKit with end-to-end encryption</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Data (Optional):</strong> If you choose to share with family members, stored in iCloud shared databases that you control</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Usage Information</h3>
      <p><strong>We do not collect usage analytics or crash reports.</strong> The App does not track how you use it, what features you access, or gather any behavioral data.</p>
      
      <h3>Device Information</h3>
      <p>The App may access standard iOS device capabilities required for functionality (such as notifications permissions), but this information is not transmitted to us or stored outside your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <p><strong>We do not use your information because we do not collect it.</strong> The App functions entirely on your device and in your personal iCloud account. We have no access to your financial data, usage patterns, or personal information.</p>
      
      <h3>App Functionality</h3>
      <p>The App uses your financial data solely to provide expense tracking services to you, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Displaying your expenses, income, and budgets</li>
        <li>Generating reports and analytics for your personal use</li>
        <li>Syncing data between your devices (if you enable iCloud sync)</li>
        <li>Sharing data with family members (if you choose to share)</li>
        <li>Exporting data for backup purposes (if you use this feature)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All processing occurs locally on your device or within your iCloud account using Apple's secure infrastructure.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p><strong>We do not share your information with third parties because we do not have access to it.</strong></p>
      
      <h3>No Third-Party Sharing</h3>
      <p>We do not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Share data with advertisers or marketing companies</li>
        <li>Sell personal information to data brokers</li>
        <li>Provide information to analytics services</li>
        <li>Share data with business partners or affiliates</li>
        <li>Transfer data to other companies or organizations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>User-Controlled Sharing</h3>
      <p>The only data sharing that occurs is when you explicitly choose to share your financial data with other iCloud users through the App's family sharing feature. This sharing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is entirely voluntary and controlled by you</li>
        <li>Uses Apple's iCloud sharing infrastructure</li>
        <li>Can be revoked by you at any time</li>
        <li>Is limited to users you specifically invite</li>
        <li>Is protected by the same end-to-end encryption</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
      <p>Since we do not collect or have access to your personal data, we cannot be compelled to provide information we do not possess. Your data in iCloud is subject to Apple's legal obligations and privacy policies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      
      <h3>Storage Options</h3>
      <p>Xpenses offers flexible storage options to suit your privacy preferences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage (Default):</strong> Your data remains stored locally on your iOS device using SwiftData, Apple's secure data persistence framework</li>
        <li><strong>iCloud Sync (Optional):</strong> Must be explicitly enabled by you; stores data in your private iCloud account</li>
        <li><strong>CSV Export/Import (Premium Feature):</strong> Allows manual backup and transfer of data under your complete control</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Security Measures</h3>
      <p>We implement industry-standard security practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> When using iCloud sync, your data is protected using Apple's CloudKit encryption support</li>
        <li><strong>Private Database:</strong> Your iCloud data is stored in your private CloudKit database, not shared storage</li>
        <li><strong>No Server Access:</strong> We have no servers that could be compromised or accessed</li>
        <li><strong>Apple's Security:</strong> Benefits from Apple's iOS and iCloud security infrastructure</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Data Encryption</h3>
      <p>Your financial information is encrypted such that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We cannot access your data</li>
        <li>Apple cannot access your encrypted financial data</li>
        <li>Only you and devices with your iCloud Keychain can decrypt the data</li>
        <li>Data in transit and at rest is protected by encryption</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p><strong>Important Security Notice:</strong> Due to end-to-end encryption, if you lose access to your iCloud Keychain and don't have recovery options configured, your encrypted data may be permanently inaccessible. We strongly recommend:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Setting up Apple ID account recovery options</li>
        <li>Maintaining iCloud Keychain recovery methods</li>
        <li>Keeping at least one device with the App installed and synced</li>
        <li>Regularly exporting data for backup purposes (Premium feature)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Data Export and Backup</h2>
      <p>As a Premium feature, Xpenses provides tools to help you maintain control and backup of your data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>CSV Export:</strong> Export your complete financial data as CSV files at any time</li>
        <li><strong>CSV Import:</strong> Import data from properly formatted CSV files to restore from backups</li>
        <li><strong>Manual Sync:</strong> Use export/import functionality to manually transfer data between devices if you prefer not to use iCloud</li>
        <li><strong>Backup Responsibility:</strong> All exported data remains your responsibility once it leaves the App</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Security Recommendation:</strong> Securely store any exported CSV files and protect them with appropriate measures, as they contain sensitive financial information. Consider encrypting exported files or storing them in secure, password-protected locations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Family Sharing and Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>As a Premium feature, Xpenses offers the ability to share expense information with family members or trusted individuals. Here's how data sharing works:</p>

        <li><strong>iCloud Infrastructure:</strong> Sharing uses Apple's iCloud shared database functionality</li>
        <li><strong>Invitation-Only:</strong> Only specifically invited iCloud users can access your shared data</li>
        <li><strong>Revocable:</strong> You can revoke access at any time through the App</li>
        <li><strong>Same Encryption:</strong> Shared data maintains the same end-to-end encryption protection</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Shared Data Scope</h3>
      <p>When you enable sharing, the shared data comprises:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expenses and income information</li>
        <li>Configured categories</li>
        <li>Budgets configuration</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Sharing Security</h3>
      <p>Shared data remains secure through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>End-to-end encryption using Apple's CloudKit</li>
        <li>Access limited to invited iCloud accounts only</li>
        <li>No intermediary storage on our servers</li>
        <li>Your ability to immediately revoke access</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>

      </ul>

        <li>We don't have access to your financial information</li>

    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>Since we do not collect or store your personal data on our servers, traditional international data transfer concerns do not apply to our service.</p>
      
      <h3>iCloud Data Location</h3>
      <p>If you enable iCloud sync, your data storage location is determined by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your Apple ID country/region settings</li>
        <li>Apple's iCloud data center locations</li>
        <li>Apple's data residency policies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For information about where your iCloud data is stored, please refer to Apple's privacy policy and iCloud documentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is designed for general use and does not specifically target children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 because we do not collect personal information from any users.</p>
      
      <h3>Family Accounts</h3>
      <p>If the App is used on a device associated with a family Apple ID or if data is shared with family members:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Parents/guardians maintain control over their children's data through Apple's Family Sharing controls</li>
        <li>The same privacy protections apply to all users regardless of age</li>
        <li>No additional data collection occurs for child users</li>
      </ul>      
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>European Union Users</h2>
      <p>For users in the European Union, this section provides additional information about your privacy rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
      
      <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
      <p>Since we do not process personal data on our servers, traditional GDPR processing bases don't apply to our service. Any data processing occurs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Locally on your device for App functionality</li>
        <li>In your iCloud account under your control (if you enable sync)</li>
        <li>Through Apple's services subject to their privacy policies</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Data Controller</h3>
      <p>For any personal data stored in iCloud (if you enable sync), you are the data controller of your own financial information. Apple acts as a data processor for iCloud services.</p>
      
      <h3>GDPR Rights</h3>
      <p>While traditional GDPR rights don't apply to us (since we don't collect your data), you maintain full control over your information through the App's features as described in the "Your Rights and Control" section above.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
